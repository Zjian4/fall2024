TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities

TIMING-28#1 Warning
Auto-derived clock referenced by a timing constraint  
The auto-derived clock mmcm0_clk0 is referenced by name inside timing constraint (see constraint position 13 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is recommended to reference an auto-derived clock by the pin name attached to the clock: get_clocks -of_objects [get_pins hostIF/mmcm0/CLKOUT0]
Related violations: <none>

XDCH-1#1 Warning
Hold option missing in multicycle path constraint  
A multicycle constraint has been set to override the setup relationship, but no multicycle constraint has been defined to change the hold relationship. As a result, the default hold for those paths is derived from the setup and may not be evaluated as expected.

Hold option missing in multicycle path constraint  
A multicycle constraint has been set to override the setup relationship, but no multicycle constraint has been defined to change the hold relationship. As a result, the default hold for those paths is derived from the setup and may not be evaluated as expected.
